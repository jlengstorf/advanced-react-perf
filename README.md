## Abstract
Getting performance right is hard, even when you have the luxury of starting an app from scratch. It's even harder when you need to improve the performance of existing apps, as is so often the case. In this workshop, Sia Karamalegos, Sara Vieira, and Jason Lengstorf will lead you through the process of:

- Assessing an existing React app
- Diagnosing performance problems
- Prioritizing highest-impact solution
- Implementing performance fixes

During this full-day workshop, youâ€™ll learn advanced techniques for improving the performance of React apps, including:

- Lazy loading resources & components with React.lazy and Suspense
- Leveraging service workers for performance
- Seamlessly preloading and prefetching assets
- Automatically optimizing images
- Dynamically subsetting fonts
- Mitigating the performance impact of third-party scripts
- Code splitting and bundle optimization
- Using psychology to make an app feel faster than it actually is

By the end of the workshop, youâ€™ll be able to diagnose and solve a variety of real-world performance problems. Youâ€™ll also learn how to weigh trade-offs to ensure that both your apps and your teams perform well. The tools added to your toolbox will continue to serve you, your team, and your users for years to come.

## Prerequisites

Intermediate React knowledge, Node/npm installed, Git installed, basic command line knowledge.
